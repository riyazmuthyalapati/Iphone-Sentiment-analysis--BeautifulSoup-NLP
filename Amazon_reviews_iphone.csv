  ¬†Another beauty from Apple. I was upgraded from iPhone X and it was great experience with all the latest specs and flawlessly smooth. Thanks to all new A14 Bionic chip.Build quality was great as always from Apple.Phone feels light on hands due to aluminium body. I chose Blue colour because wanted to go for different colour than routine Black and white iPhones so initially I was bit skeptical but after seeing the phone in person I‚Äôm happy with the blue colour  ‚Äú not bad at all and not too flashy‚ÄùGrip and feel perfect. Phone comes with iOS 14.1. Camera quality was excellent and sufficient  as a normal user.If you are from iOS ecosystem nothing will go wrong here.There is nothing to question about the quality and interface from Apple ( it‚Äôs my personal opinion as a long time apple user)As you all know iPhone 12 won‚Äôt comes with earphones and charging brick( adapter)I bought separately 20w apple adapter from new Apple India online store for Rs.1900I don‚Äôt judge here apple because of accessories removal and the price tag. I hope apple can justify this.I only hope and wanted to see so badly Made in India IPhones so that we all can enjoy lower priced ( at least a better priced) iPhones in the future.A big thanks to Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd and Amazon for delivering genuine iPhone as always in perfect condition. Delivered way before the promised date.Update: (01/12/2020) After testing 25 days especially on battery life of this iPhone 12, results were amazing and I‚Äôm completely satisfied  with the battery performance. On Moderate gaming, Moderate Video Content, heavy on calls and heavy on browsing this iPhone 12 battery life is sufficient for your regular Day.My conclusion is definitely a better and improved battery performer than the previous iPhone model.Thank you Apple IndiaThank you Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd.Thank you Amazon India.( Note: charger brick was shown in my video was bought myself from Apple India online store because it won‚Äôt comes with the phone)"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,This phone is a joke and the joke is on us!!! Don‚Äôt buy this phone.,1.0,"Extremely disappointed with this phone. It‚Äôs a seemingly average phone which is over priced by 4 to 5 times at least. This phone is a joke in comparison with any Samsung flagship phone. I am shocked that so many fools like me are falling for apple‚Äôs trickery and gimmickry.The battery doesn‚Äôt last half a day. Screen size is average. Thickness of this phone will constantly remind you that this phone belongs to another era. 64gb space won‚Äôt be enough for anyone.And then there are other apple quirks - won‚Äôt come with a SD card, won‚Äôt come with a charging brick or a set of head phones. Your headphones with the regular audio pin won‚Äôt work with this one. Face ID won‚Äôt work with masks on. So your forced to remove your masks when you‚Äôre out and vulnerable. This phone won‚Äôt allow you set google maps as default. So you continue to suffer using their apple map which I bet even Tim Cook doesn‚Äôt use. You won‚Äôt be able to set google chrome as your default browser as iOS won‚Äôt let you.Overall the phone is overpriced and overrated. Anybody with half the wit will figure that this phone is a joke and a mere marketing gimmick. An ordinary phone like this shouldn‚Äôt cost you more than 12 to 14K.Apple is going down!Amazon won‚Äôt take this phone back as they have a 10 day return policy. So I am pretty much stuck with this damn excuse for a phone till I get to upgrade to a Samsung phone."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,The Beast,5.0,"This was my first switch to an ios device after using an android untill now. And I am not disappointed. The build quality, the responsive touch, the display, the camera, the battery life are just exceptional.Been using for about 10 days now, and consistently giving around 7h of screen on time.The camera is just way too good. Espeecially the night mode impressed me a lot.Only issue when switching from Android to iPhone I encountered was to be not able to restore my whatsapp chats. There are no official/free ways for doing this.The phone is simple amazing."

If you are using your phone on wifi than it will last a day easily without any problem.2.

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Not Really worth the money,4.0,"I have been an android user for the past 8+ years. Recently was using iphone 6 for the past few months, liked it much and wanted to switch to ios. I did not want to regret, so i purchased the best in the market, going with iphone 12. Honestly, I dont feel its worthy. Perfomance wise, its good. A lot other phones like MI, 1+ everything gives us a very nice perfomance too. The A14 chip is just a tag line to sell the phone. Are we really going to process million instructions per second on a mobile phone? Defenitely not.Battery, After charging it to 100% in the morning, I am hardly getting 1 full day with average use. My battery is almost 20% at the end of the day with a screentime of 4-4.3 hours[Update : With low power mode, it makes a 6 hour day, ending with 30%]. Camera quality is amazing in natural light. Yes, as specified it works so nice in night light, but please dont mistake night light as no-light. Front camera is still average. The same things i see in every other mid range android phones. I am still using JIO 4g. Not sure how this would work on 5g (must drain even faster)Face detenction, the color of the phone, Water resistant and all stuffs are nice to have, fancy items.  But not really convinced if this is all we get for 84k?Fast charging - I bought a 20W charger from apple store for Rs.1900. I plug in when the battery is 20-25% and it takes 1.45 hours to reach 100%. If this is all about fast charging you are looking for, well and good. I never tried with magsafe, honestly. But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.PROS : Camera & PerfomanceCONS : Battery and Cost"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,"Performance is excellent,battery draining too fast and heating issue",4.0,"I am writing this review after 40 days of use of iPhone 12. phone camera is excellent like DSLR ,very fast processor ,face ID feature looks great ,overall everything is fine but only issue which this phone has is , battery draining too fast. You can use 100% battery only for 5-6 hours of continuous use after that you have to charge it. Apple should look into this."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,How to decide between iPhone 11 and 12,4.0,"After thinking a lot, I decided to go ahead with iPhone 12. The original price is ‚Çπ 84900. After credit card discount(‚Çπ6000), old phone exchange(‚Çπ3450) and reward points money(‚Çπ4530) inclusion, I bought it for ‚Çπ70920. There‚Äôs also an additional 3000 discount on red and white variants but I couldn‚Äôt let go of blue1. PRICE: Considering iPhone 11 would be supported by iOS for 4 years, based on the current price it‚Äôd cost 13k per year and iPhone 12 for 5 years would cost 14.9k(excluding exchange discount) per year. For me price gap for both phones didn‚Äôt seem to make a huge difference as IPhone 11 is already an year old and costing only a 2k less per year.2: DISPLAY: I‚Äôve purchased iPhone 11 for my mom last year and been observing the display for some months. Compared to iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 display is far superior and has better pixel quality.3: BEZELS: the bezels of iPhone 12 are much thinner and makes the phone look decent unlike in 11. Apart from this, the phone is incredibly light making it easy to hold it.How to choose between 64/128gb:If you‚Äôre not really tight on budget, I‚Äôd suggest to go for 128gb variant. I‚Äôve been using one plus for 1.5 years and storage  occupied about 60gb. So it‚Äôd make good sense to check your current phone usage. Either way you can also opt for iCloud 50gb storage which would cost approximately the difference amount of 64 and 128 go for 5 years.CONS:1. Could have definitely included the charger for the price2. If you‚Äôre an android user, migration would be little time consumingUpdate: I‚Äôve uploaded a couple of pictures shot using automatic night mode. :)"

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Apparaio Retail & Amazon doing absolute frauds with customers,1.0,I purchased new apple iphone12 with exchange of my samsung m31. from day1 while charging the body is conducting electricity .replaced chargers but still same issue. cross checked earthing of home-it is fine . then contacted apple support . they told me to get a replacement from the seller but amazon is just avoiding to replace. they asked emails proofs of case id of apple support. I provided them but still they are not assuring replacement . They sell defective products and do not replace. THIS IS DISGUSTING

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,One beast of a phone.,5.0,"I am writing this after a week of my usage with this iPhone 12. I have had the X before and OnePlus 6T as well.Overall experience of switching to iOS again is so good. The Interface, the speed, smoothness, camera, support, and everything is so well crafter.I‚Äôll be talking about the pros and cons with respect to the apple standards of course.Pros:1. The design is absolutely wonderful, its very very light weight and premium feeling phone with vintage boxy look.2. The speed, the performance.3. Camera of course. The normal picture comes out pretty good, they don‚Äôt usually need any professional touch.4. Battery life - I‚Äôll talk about the battery life in day to day life instead of nerdy Screen On Time. I am a doctor and usually don‚Äôt play much games on this but I surf web a lot, youtube videos, social media and a lot of WhatsApp and sometimes heavy use for 10% of the time. It can get through one day pretty easily with around 8-9 hr Screen on time, 10hr Stand by time, so you can relate now. Don‚Äôt believe that it has bad battery, it has a pretty good battery.ConsNothing much until now.The back of the phone is fingerprint magnet, attracts a lot of them.Another concern was the charging adapter which is not provided in the box."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Confused? Read on! One stop review for your flagship purchase.,5.0,"I went through a lot of reviews and articles before I decided on the iPhone 12. I‚Äôve been an Android user all my life and frankly thought Apple phones were really overpriced(at least here in India). But in the present day, the flagship Android options are no less expensive. If you spend a lot of time on your mobile, using it as your primary camera, social media device, business emails/collaboration and also to stream videos then you definitely need to spend a little more and go with a flagship option for the best experience.Coming to the flagships today (Aug2021),  apart from the iPhone we have Samsung Galaxy S21/+/ultra, Oneplus 9 pro, Vivo x60 pro+, mi 11ultra.  If you read a few reviews you‚Äôll understand that 888Snapdragon has a lot of heating issues  and 9pro cameras didn‚Äôt live up to the hype(also overheating when the camera is in use). Samsung in India ships the phone with exynos2100 which is way less powerful than 888. The prices of all these phones are in the same range (except the ultra). Imp note: iOS updates are across iPhone devices unlike the android updates.Apple has really done a lot of things right on the iPhone12:1. They changed its display from lcd to led (huge value jump)2. A14 Bionic chip is a really fast and smooth without any lag3. Huge improvement on the primary cameras. Still the best video recording phone in the market and the photos are top quality4. The change is the body design is really comfortable in the hand5. The haptics are spot onWhat‚Äôs Missing: (Minor misses though)1. The Notch. Really wish they get rid of the notch but looks like it wont be out until 2023. Anyway you‚Äôll get used to it.2. USB type C charging. The iPad Pro 2020 model onwards already comes with the TypeC usb charging. I guess the iPhone 13 would get this change3. Fingerprint Sensor: Yes. Apple had done away with it couple of years back but with the pandemic still on, you sometimes wish there was a fingerprint sensorWait for the iPhone 13 or go with the 12:It took a while for 12‚Äôs prices to fall.  If you‚Äôre willing to wait till Feb-March 2022 for a good deal then wait for the 13. If you want to change it now, go with the 12.64GB or 128GB:The difference is around ‚Çπ6000.  64GB if you don‚Äôt play too many games and keep dumping the media files every once in while to your pc/storage . Else, the 128üòäBattery:I was indeed very surprised with the battery life. Charging time is a little slower compared to  it‚Äôs competition but the back up is impressive. It easily lasts a day.Android Flagship Option:The truth is, right now is not a good time to purchase an android flagship. If you really want to buy an android flagship, do wait for a while. 895 snapdragon phones are expected to be out by end of the year or early 2022.Hope this review helped :)Update:13 gets a better cam sensor, a15 bionic, 10% bigger battery and a slightly smaller notch. That‚Äôs it. No more differences. Everything else remains the same.iPhone 13 launched at 80k which is lesser than 12‚Äôs launch price(86k).  If you want to save on some cash , 12 will still  do the job (12 is currently around 55k-62k).  However if you can spend that extra 20k, then 13 should be your pick.Planning on taking an Android? Definitely wait until early 2022."

  ¬†Dear Team,Please be informed that I am very dissatisfied by the services provided by Amazon buying this much expensive mobile from Amazon is not worth I believe they always provide us the defected item I recently purchased I phone 12 and it is creating a problem while switching on had to try multiple times for the same and this problem occurs every time whenever I switch off the mobile last time also the same issue occur when I bought my One plus 08 there was issue related to camera image was getting blurred each time and then I have to replace it I think Amazon just sell defected items I am very angry and wil take it forward because it's second time in a row and will never suggest any one to buy mobile especially from Amazon and also want to post the review about this on social media"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,iPhone 12 review,3.0,"Positives: Very fast, Picture Quality, video quality seems superb,  less charging time required.Cons: Shorter battery life than specified and expected."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,"READ before BUY ! ""Iphone 12! Worth buying or not?""",4.0,"From owner POV, It's completely different experience for me as I've come from a long line of android platform. But the UI is very attractive. I think it surpassed my expectations as a consumer. But as a rational thinker, 79k is a lot for a phone which carry a little amount of specs ships. I'm lucky that I have a Amazon business account, so getting a GST bill.As per the limitations :1. 60 Hz display (with the beautiful UI animations, it doesn't feel like one)2. Google exceeds on Maps, contacts and AI capabilities.3. Hefty price tag. (I mean! Wtf is this! 80k! Are you serious?)4. Necessity of a 1900 INR charger (That too of 20W and without extra cable. Why?)5. One sillicon case worth 4600 INR ( Sorry! My name's not Sanjib 'Ambani' ! Terrible joke! I know! I left my sarcasm capabilities at an Apple store for leverage.)Advantages:1. It's a flagship iPhone 12 with A14 bionic processor and it's best in the market.2. The UI and the optimization (And I came from an Android background.)3. Display (Can't find much difference if you're a Samsung flagship user.)4. The design and in-hand feel.5. The build quality, you can feel by holding it that it's premium.Overall, I found it very attractive and worthy of the money spent. (Because I am telling my mind this only as justification for a 80k expenditure)On a serious note, as coming from an Android background, if Samsung could launch a flagship with Snapdragon latest processor, I could think of buying that.But iPhone 12 in 2020?  its a technological wonder. It's very slim, premium and beautiful.If you're comfortable to spend 80k, you should go for it for a wonderful experience."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,For first time iPhone Users,5.0,"When the iPhone 11 prices were announced, I was in a dilemma whether to go for the 11 or wait for 12. And since it was my first iPhone, I thought why not get the 12. The logic being: The phone will last for a couple of years (provided you don't drop it often), and if you are looking for a phone for a long time horizon, then go for the 12. This one with the better chip and the display will be able to handle the upcoming updates as well the apps which will get even more intensive in the future.All technical specs are really good, display is an OLED one, even visible in extreme sunlight. Build quality is miles apart, my brother uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, and holding this one is way way out of the leagues of all the android phones. Processor and RAM are capable of even running multiple intensive applications, I had Adobe LightRoom, iMovie, and a couple of apps open, all to slide between them seamlessly. The trick here is that since apps are only made for a very few iPhones and iOS versions, these apps are hardware integrated, hence work better. A classic example is Instagram. Instagram does feel a bit more polished on the iPhone than android. FaceID even works when there's no light, so thats that. But it can't identify you with the mask, you're left to the PIN when you're in the outside.The Battery: Yes it has a smaller battery, yes with intensive use it will run out in a day, but if you are a bit prudent with it, it'll definitely last for more than a day. I use 4G in between, outdoor photography a bit, editing, email, Apple Music, Youtube, WhatsApp and Instagram. By the end of the day (7:00 PM) , I usually have 40 percent remaining.So yes, its an iPhone and yes its really something nice to hold and use daily."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Never buy expensive items from Amazon,1.0,"Device is wonderful but never buy expensive items from Amazon, its better to purchase from Apple store.Delayed delivery by 3 days and on top of it no one in amazon knows where my device was. I have to perform multiple follow ups to enquire about my device and Amazon CSR is worst when it comes to logging a complaint.The final product received is having a dent and Amazon denied servicing and asked to check with Apple, Apple of-course denied since the product is purchased from third party e-commerce website.Lesson learned after 5 days of total frustration and being played as shuttlecock between Amazon and Apple, its better to spend few bucks more and purchase iPhone from Apple rather than typing this review with a dented device."

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Perfect replacement for a long time android user,5.0,"Okay I NEED TO CLEAR a few misconceptions about this phone because i am seeing a lot of negative reviews here which are not true, probably from IOS haters. I have been an android user since 2014 when I got my first phone, after many years i switched to Apple after complaining about their high prices  because i was disappointed with Samsung using Exynos processors for their flagship phones in India which causes heating, and Oneplus throwing one cheap model after another every six months.And trust me guys its amazing. The software is butter smooth, i might never go back to android again.  FIRST OF ALL - who said the battery life is bad? I got my phone at 70 percent charge at 2 pm and after 24 hours it was 20 percent EVEN AFTER I KEPT MY DATA PACK ON THE WHOLE TIME.SECONDLY- why are so many guys reviewing the phone on basis of the charger? everyone knows iphone 12 comes without an adapter. did you people not do your research before buying?THIRD - the 60 Hz thing does not matter at all, flipping screen is  real quick u wont even notice the difference from a 120 Hz in androidand lastly - the AI is so sharp, be it the camera which automatically detects low light or even the face recognition.overall this phone is worth the high price. i will definitely be using it for 4-5 years. a happy customer here"

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,I miss my OnePlus 6,3.0,"Android v/s iOSPro Apple1. Tons of privacy features and solid implementation. Every new app installed needs permission to send notifications.And with a future update, facebook won't be able to track what you're doing in other apps outside of Facebook. This deserves an applaud. 2. BatteryThe battery is amazing, giving more than 6 hours of screen on time. OnePlus can't touch this. If you bring this up with them, they'll distract you by saying it has fast charging.3. Camera - photos are ok and decent BUT, DAMN, the video quality is amazing. Totally stabilized ready for uploads.4. Build Quality - SOLID.5. Continued updates for years and years. An android may last you 2-4 years, and the updated would be ""raam bharose"", but these new iphones especially will easily last 5 years minimum with no compromises on software and security upgrades.6. Less features, but they work 10/10. Example, auto fill OTP option in keyboard works every single timein iPhone. In Android, if your keyboard is open already before the otp arrives, then this feature won't work. Half baked implementation.Pro Android / Anti - iOS1. Notifications. Notifications centre on iPhone SUCKS. I have missed email notifications regularly. Android does this so well.2. Implementation of new app library feature sucks. This creates a very confusing situation. The way to solve this would be if the auto-folders in app library could be manually managed.3. Screen Sizes and Notch - The Notch is a disgrace for iphones when the iphones have reached the level of punch hole displays. Hoping the next year's model can make it better.4. No Truecaller in iPhone and no call recording. I can forgive the call recording considering the privacy first model, but truecaller is a pro to privacy.5. CHEAP QUALITY OF CHARGING CABLE. For a luxury brand, this is a disgrace.6. PRICE - Yes, iphones are expensive BUT, paying +10-15k for a phone available cheaper in Dubai / USA really pinches. Damn Taxes.7. Yes iPhones run smoothly but don't think that these don't stutter. I face very light stutters now and then and I restart at least once a week whenever I encounter it.I'll probably give this phone to my family member against their iPhone x since they're way too deep in ios ecosystem now."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Phone is great but iOS sucks,3.0,"First of all, I don't know why people here are leaving misleading reviews, I didn't feel any sort of heating issue or something like that, neither my phone is damaged nor it is refurbished. These sort of reviews are only making other people sceptical.Now let's talk about the cell phone itself.It is great, I love it. The reason why I gave 3 stars is because I have been an android user before this device and I am being honest right now :-iOS sucks in terms of user experience, Android is easy to use and makes a lot of sense (believe me, I was a hardcore android user, I didn't only use it for playing games and making calls). In iOS I kinda feel like being constraint.let me give you few example, which are quite obvious but still not in iOS:-1. Notifications- You can't reply through notifications.- Notifications from a similar user/ sender do bundle, but you can only see the latest message (You can't just swipe down on notification to preview the messages)- if you want to remove a particular notification then you have to swipe two times to the left. If you swiped right then it will open the message for you (lol).- Notifications are so huge, sometimes it's really painful to scroll through all the notifications.2. App library- It has something called app library, they thought it'd be cool to make one but by giving their own flavor. They bundled things in their respective folder not like in android where each icon represent an app. You have to explicitly click on search(app library) to see all apps in the list view or to search an app. Just copy android, no one is slapping you in the face for that.3. whatsapp- Using whatsapp is really frustating sometimes.- To send some media to a contact, there are three processes. Two times it will do preparing and then one time it will do the sending (finally). if you are sending some big media to someone then you can literally get a 15 min power nap and then grab a cup of coffee and drink it, still there might be chances that the iOS would be in one of the preparing process.- Sometimes when you click on someone's profile then instead of opening the user's profile, whatsapp tends to scroll to the location from where that current day chats are starting (I think that is whatsapp's issue not iOS)- You can't directly send any media as a document (preserving it's quality). There are steps to do that too.The above points are few examples, I will keep updating them as per my experience.I am not saying iOS is slow or the phone's hardware is bad, it's actually quite opposite of bad, it's fast and amazing.I just hated the user experience domain of iOS. It really really sucks. iOS should bluntly copy the android things so that the HARDCORE IPHONE USERS will know what user experience they were missing."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,DEFECTIVE / REFURBISHED IPHONE,1.0,The item looks to be defective and I really doubt that it‚Äôs a refurbished / seconds / faulty device sold by the dealer. I had put up for replacement but I don‚Äôt know it doesn‚Äôt shows pick up. It‚Äôs showing replacement possible till 01 Mar 21 but not showing and date of collection.
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Worst Phone ever in my life,1.0,Phone is heating up a lot while shooting a Video and playing a Game even very much difficult to hold such a hot. Some of the function not at all working like Call forwarding morning I have forwarded my call to other number and evening I am trying to turn it off but I am unable to enter into the function at all it rotating from past 2 Hours. Please I recommend not to purchase this Phone at all. It is totally a waste of money. Even security features like face unlock is automatically getting canceled out.

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Decent buy.,5.0,"Really happy with the purchase. But 2x zoom missing does make a little difference. Performance, Display, camera and battery are on point and that what matters the most to me. I was planning on buying the pro model but this year it was insanely expensive. So Bought this and saved some money for decent accessories. The value for money is great for the 128gb version."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,"Unmatched Quality, Simple & Powerful",5.0,"The overall feel of the iPhone is very good. The weight of the phone is light & comfortable & size too for daily use. The screen, colours & image quality is unmatched. The colors on camera & photo are natural. Fingerprint reading & facial recognition is superb & very quick & highly accurate."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Long Term Review: Excellent All Rounder Device,5.0,"This is going to be a long review, sit back, relax and have a read.I bought the iPhone 12 in May of 2021 after selling my OnePlus.Having used the iPhone7 and XR for years, this was my third iPhone.I have to say the iOS experience on the XR was absolutely horrible. Terrible reception, average battery and mediocre cameras forced me to move to android. I was tempted to move the 12 for all the improvements in modems, screen and the camera.And boy was I surprised . Let‚Äôs take up the review in sections.1. Screen: Having used a high refresh rate screen of OP8 before, I was quite sceptical about the 60hz of iPhone12 before I bought it. But, astonishingly, the iPhone12 screen is buttery smooth, courtesy of the high touch sampling rate and excellent animations. This does not feel like a 60hz display, and I cannot stress this enough. The display is EXCELLENT .2. Camera: being a photographer who has spent half of his life travelling, I prioritise a good camera over anything else. And these are surely the most spectacular cameras that I have used on a smartphone. Excellent HDR, great details and very post processing friendly. Of course, the video is as good as it gets on a phone. Attaching some images I shot on the 12 for your reference. Trust me when I say this, you could use this for some semi professional shoot just fine, if it‚Äôs only for social media and you are not printing really big.3. Battery: Battery on this device is not spectacular, it‚Äôs average. It will get you through the day for sure, unless you are in very long video calls two three times a day. It is good enough, on par with my OnePlus.4. Build Quality: this is where it is head and shoulders above the competition. Rock solid, an led weirdly lightweight, this feels very, very premium.5. Software: iOS 14 and the iOS15 have really pushed the sub par experience of ios11 away, and this software now feels smoother than ever. Great improvements. Excellent software experience, not something I could say with my XR.Summary: Excellent device, with no complains. This could really be one of the first devices that I used which I can call perfect. Highly recommended."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Fault quality product delivered,1.0,"The product you delivered actually not value for money, dent products which I can't identify were apple authorized personDetected and found dent and they denied my service under warranty, very bad product delivered and after service also not satisfying, look like refurbished product delivered to me. Will go for consumer court to satisfy the complaint."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,"Worst Camera, Performance is not that fast",1.0,"Worst camera and graphics if you compare pubg in oneplus mobiles and this phone, this phone‚Äôs graphics was worst like oppo phone graphics. And coming camera compare to this phone oppo is better phone than this. If apple continue like this this oneplus will lead the market."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Selling defective pieces during sale!!,1.0,"Bought an iPhone 12 during ongoing freedom sale and I received a defective piece as the phone has tiny dents around the charging port. I tried returning it but there‚Äôs no option to replace or return.  Don‚Äôt know what to do, stuck with it after spending 62 K."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,WHAT an upgrade from iPhone 8! Feels amazing in the hand! Like a bar of glass!,5.0,Great battery life. Love the white colour. Blue is super hyped. It is a finger print magnet.There‚Äôs something about the design of these phones. No android phone can match the aesthetics. Except some curved display screens.Upgraded from iPhone 8. I am very very happy.Wish it was a bit cheaper. Bought with 6k instant hdfc discount and 6 months no cost emi.128gb.
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Smart option compared to pro model,5.0,"Upgraded for iPhone XR. Battery lasts almost the same as XR but iPhone adapts as per usage over time so it will take time. Which anyways it lasts me for around 1.5 day with normal use and data services and location services always on. Do check the YouTube video to make necessary changes in settings for battery optimisation. Nothing beats the camera performance and let alone the video performance. Phone factor (rectangular edges) feels good to hold however even the MagSafe back cover when put on ruins the fun. Instead try buying a thin screen guard for back of the phone and tempered glass for the front glass as both front and back of the phone seem to be delicate and a costly affair when planning repairs. Overall the performance is great. The backup for Mini is pathetic, buy only if you have very minimal use of the phone. If a telephoto photography doesn‚Äôt seem to be on your agenda then this is a smart choice over the pro model."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Sent me Faulty Rear Camera Iphone 12,1.0,"Worst camera quality, want my money refund but Apple denied to refund and amazon asking to go Apple service center to have deny later from Apple. If you are planning to buy an iphone then please buy from stores only if you want genuine one. I got a defective product from seller. And After paying my hard earned money iphone says thats not their responsibility third class service centers, don't care customers time."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Defective phone recieved,1.0,"I received the phone with a crack on its screen which was apparently not visible to a naked eye.But this crack started to increase in size and became more visible after few days when the phone started heating. Now Amazon has taken there hands out of this matter and neither apple is helping me, furthermore they are asking me to get my screen replaced which will cost me ‚Çπ26500. So I request everyone to not buy there  phones  from Amazon."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Beware of exchange,1.0,"My existing iPhone was not exchanged and the reasons too weren't cited. The existing phones were in good condition. I dare Amazon to give me the reasons for not exchanging it if they have one. So don't fall for the exchange pray, appears to be a ploy. My umpteen emails to Amazon customer service on this topic was unanswered and finally upon escalation, the Executive CS team wrote back stating that the reasons for exchange can't be shared as it's an internal communication of theirs. Quite absurd! I quote below the etracts of their email dated 25th Aug 2021... Quote: I've reviewed your concern and see that our customer service team was able to address your issue concerning your exchange being denied. We are unable to provide internal information about the reason for exchanges being denied. Unquote:Now that's a complete surprise to a customer... If my phone doesn't gets exchanged, as customers I need to know the reasons too.. denial by Amazon to give a reason implies here that the exchange options are a gimmick to lure in customers to buy Phones on their online store.. Definitely, never expected Amazon to behave in this manner. Asides, Amazon CS took conveniently more than 2 weeks to respond to my emails and when they have responded the return window too is closed!!! Sad :("

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,DON'T BUY HERE,1.0,I got this phone on 4th May. And something was wrong with this phone. Also my brother bought the same phone but from a store. And that's working perfectly.Also apple gives 14 day return policy on each apple product but they closed my return window in 6 daysI started facing battery issues after few days. Phone was charging from 0-100% in about half an hour and same with the discharge.It went from 100 to 46% in 15 minutes and sometimes sudden shutdowns. I visited service centres and still my issues have not been resolved.I tried amazon support to help me but nothing happened and still the device is not in well condition and I can't use it.I had already checked that my product is genuine by filling all the details at apple website.But something is wrong either from amazon or apple.I can recommend if you are buying this device buy it a from a genuine store.In order to save 2-3k I made a mistake I guess.
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,My first iphone,5.0,"Buying an iphone was a dream for me . This is my first ios device , The most i liked about this iphone is the inhand feel light weight,compact boxy design helps easy to hold the fone. When i was planned to switch from android to ios most of my frds told that battery life is a minus in iphones, but frankly i tell that the battery life effortlessly lasts for one complete day.Camera, display,sounds are awsome. The main attractive of this device is its permformance, no lag , best optimised software and gaming is simply awesome."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Want replacement,1.0,The phone worked fine for 10 days after that the phone started heating and after that the charging was slow and now its 1month and the phone's speaker is not working .. i have given 84000 for this product to your company and i have called ur support system but they have told me to go to apple service center..I have taken the phone today and they have told me that it will take 7 days to fix it .. but my point is that i want a new phone or i want my money back as i m not 1% satisfied with ur product and customer service so plzz dnt put ur company name down and provide me a new phone if the phone dosent satisfy me after the phone is returned to me by the apple service center . Or else i will go to consumer court .. plzz call me as soon as possible and provide me a proper reply and if i dont get any solution that is good to me then i will file an case in the consumer court .
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Impressive product by a money hungry company (lol),5.0,"Likes:ios- efficient and tidy.5G; Jio gives 4G+ currently to 5G mobiles as of 27-Dec-2020.The chassis feels different than rest phones in a good way.OLED display feels good to view.Usual iPhone perks- longer software support.Dislikes:Overpriced as usual, more so this time since not bundled with earphones and charger.Apple charger doesn't come with a lightning cable. Please buy cable separately, if needed.The selfie camera dulls the skin tone. Selfies taken via Androids look better.Here's my 2 cents:I'm using it as a secondary phone with OnePlus 8 as my primary.Please use your discretion.Thanks."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Made a mistake,2.0,"Product delivered on 3 Jan, today is 6th Jan 2022 time 12:08 am. Problem with the product that got delivered to me is it's front camera hangs a lot, there's no newness of the product which made me feel like I have been decived with refurbished phone. ( Though I am not sure but as I said there is no newness also battery backup was real poor, I still remember when I bought one plus 5T it's battery lasted for atleast 2-3 days without any recharging but this product that delivered to me either it is not authentic or I have received defective one. Obviously seller won't return the item so u have to visit store to sort out your problems with phone. I hate it."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Not worthy,3.0,"In this mask era, fingerprint is a must and sadly this phone doesn't have it. Being a doctor, I find it very difficult. Since I don't use it much, battery life is 2 days. Face recognition doesn't work with a mask and specs on. Better buy a Redmi which costs ‚Çπ9,000 than this one for ‚Çπ75,000 just to show off."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Purple color can be vibrantly distinguished amongst other available colors,4.0,The product was delivered before the expected date of delivery‚Ä¶. Review will be coming up after few weeks usage and the color is quiet vibrant.
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,"Over heating, freezing to death",1.0,"Phone is good and it fits really well in hand. Only problem I have found in iPhone 12 is overheating and this started from the moment I have unboxed it. I have tried to contact Apple and Amazon but no one is agree to help me fix this heating issue or replace it.freezing to death all within 6 months and best part there is no after sales support either by Apple or Amazon.Kind of service I have received from Apple, I think this is my first and last iPhone, second apple product and last.It's better to get it from other platform or get it from store, Amazon does not provide any after sales support for iPhone 12.Overall horrible service from giants organization like, Apple and Amazon."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,My worst mistake is to buy this product online,1.0,"I am writing this, so nobody else end up in my situation. Bought a brand new iphone 12 from amazon for republic day sale. The product was defective , storage issues were there. System data itself was consuming 50 gb of total space so my phone was immediately full.Called Amazon support as it was within replacement period, they asked for a service denial report from apple service centre. When I checked with the service centre they informed apple never shares a service denial letter . And by my logic it was reasonable as how can apple deny service for their own product under warranty. Anyways amazon was useless , no support provided stating some strange reasons (service denial letter) !!Took this to apple service centre (iplanet vr mall bangalore) they kept my phone for 14 days doing nothing. They confirmed the phone is defective at the first place but was not able to support as it is a software glitch. They want me to escalate it through apple support only. Irony is I submitted it in service centre as per the suggestion by apple online support.At the end I am in a clueless situation not getting to know what to do with this product after spending 62000 INR. I suggest NOBODY to buy any apple product from amazon even if it looks so tempting with discounts and sales. Please dont fall pray for this trap."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Touch screen stoped working in 5 days of purchase,1.0,I bought this iPhone 12 128 GB after  3 days slowly letter b stoped working on keyboard I thought it was software glitch as sometime updateing software would solve the issue as we are in a pandamic situation I moved to my village where there little reception so update took 2 to 3 days to download. But even after updating there was no improvement so called apple support spoke to then at length about my situation and after hearing me they did some troubleshooting and came to a conclusion that it has some hardware problem and should approach Amazon as they were responsible for selling me this product for replacement.  by this time 7 days completed and according to the Amazon policy they only return and replace for 7 days.  When spoke to Amazon customer care they just wouldn't connect me to the concern department they just bluntly say I should approach apple but apple executive tells me he can't do anything. Is this how you treat a loyal customer you can check my account the and frequency I order trough Amazon. Not even connecting call to the concern department.
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,iPhone 12 screen is a major bummer!!,3.0,It‚Äôs such a disappointment. I have been using iPhone since it‚Äôs first version.So naturally upgraded from iPhone X to 12. But the excitement quickly died down as soon as I saw the screen. There is a warm greenish tint to it which makes the colors off.Selfie portraits aren‚Äôt good either. Too sharp for portraits. May be I should have gone for the 12 Pro Max as it handles much better because of the telephoto lens.Hope apple fixes the screen issues soon
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Poor battery,1.0,Worst battery. It does not even go for 1 whole day with minimum usage. On idle mode battery will drain out in 1.5 days.
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Pathetic for a 50K+ phone to not include a charger,1.0,What kind of greedy scumbags don't even include a charger in their phone? Separately buying it costs 2K extra
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,"Apple what are you doing?

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Horrible experience,1.0,"I bought this phone just for creating video content.My main intention to buy this was it's mind-blowing camera.But guess what, when the phone got delivered the only thing not working was it's camera.Now,neither Amazon and not the so called APPLE is replacing the phone even after agreeing that there is a manufacturing defect in the phone.They just repaired this defective phone .Really upset with Amazon and APPLE service providers.Will never buy or recommend anyone else to buy APPLE's product from now on..#Unsatisfiedcustomer"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Phone over-heating from rear,1.0,"Upgraded to brand new iPhone 12 (128gb) last week and from very first moment could feel the phone getting warmer to hotter from rear side and heat travels from back to side bezels making it even unable to hold the phone during FaceTime or work calls. After calling thrice to Apple official support, the staff was disconcerted and blamed it upon ‚Äònormal behaviour‚Äô of phone. However Amazon was kind enough to understand the issue and provided support to me. I recommend Amazon customer service."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Expected a lot..but got nothing,1.0,"The product was getting overheated too soon while using apple apps like iMovie.Also got heated while chargingIf I have to buy an 80k phone and just make calls and messages... doesn't make sense..And Amazon would not replace it just like that they need a letter from Apple stating ""Service Denial"" so shuttling between Amazon and Apple after 2 days of purchase."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Colour chipping issue!! Do not buy unless Apple accepts it,4.0,Do not buy.. there is colour chipping issue around camera. And it is not happening with me only.. so many complaints are there for this but apple is not bothered about it.

No need of buying fancy iphone 12 pro max this is more than enough yaarüòçüòçYou will never ever regret buying thisReviewing after a use of 2 months"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Great purchase!,4.0,"I used to use an Android phone till 2014 and wanted to switch to iOS, so the same year I bought iPhone 6, It was good to have an iOS device and the performance and the cameras but those were sufficient only until next year when 6s launched. Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but couldn't buy them somehow. I wasn't and I'm not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn't eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I'm quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.When it comes to iPhone 12, it's a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I'm gonna used to of it.I bought a 128 GB device as per my requirement and colour white because finger prints on back are not visible, compared to other darker colours.INR 3000‚Çπ Discount on the colour white, plus 6000‚Çπ HDFC instant discount. Effective price 76000‚Çπ. Unfortunately Charging Brick isn't included and it coasted 1900‚Çπ more for 20W USB-C from Apple India website.Overall it's a great device and satisfied purchase but overpriced for sure."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,A good uograde,5.0,"Overall it looks good, coming from XR it looks a good upgrade for me. Design is ‚Äòback to basics‚Äô which is compelling. I loved the fast response among other things."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Overall good phone with some minor setbacks.,4.0,"Overall good phone as it feels very premium, being made with high quality materials and has great performance. Excellent camera quality, great design and screen quality. The A14 processor is super fast and the phone never heats up even while performing intensive tasks. The speakers are very loud and clear and give out high quality sound.One problem I encountered is that  the battery life is not great but definitely above average. Another issue is the notch which makes the phone look outdated especially in 2021. The Face ID is also not useful while wearing masks which causes a lot of inconvenience since the phone doesn‚Äôt have a fingerprint scanner. The phone is also limited to a 60Hz refresh rate which again makes it less compelling than the competition which makes phones with 120Hz refresh rate at a much lower price."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Excellent buy all latest IoS,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Huge leap for the standard iPhone,5.0,"Upgraded from an iPhone 7 32 gigs to iPhone 12 . After holding out for a long time the upgrade was worth it. All the feature set display, camera, speakers, signal reception, chipset is a huge upgrade. Recommended if you happen to have a device from 2016 or older. This device will be the new standard iPhone for the next 4 years. So worth it if you get it now."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Best selling phone in the world!!!,4.0,"No wonder Apple makes some of the best phones in the world. Iphone 12 deservedly is the highest selling phone.I was upgrading from iphone 7 which served me well for 4 years, which I exchanged for this.The delivery & exchange formalities were smooth.The phone itself is surely an upgrade when compared to 7, the display is top notch, the camera is probably the best there is, the face unlock works like a charm, what's to say about the best phone, it works even better than advertised.The only problem like always is the battery which hardly lasts a day & charging time is also an issue, it tends to heat up a little while charging but with the previous experience with iphone 7, the longevity of the phone is guaranteed with the timely updates from Apple, the premium which an iphone demands stands justified with a superior product.Some people tried to discourage me from buying an iphone from Amazon claiming warranty & support issues. But there's no substance to such things. I confirmed the warranty & product registration from Apple, it's as advertised.Since most of us are going to use it for a longer period of time, it's prudent to opt for the extended warranty offered by Apple which costs around 16500 which gives us an extended year of warranty. Do remember to do this within 3 months of your purchase."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Its a beast phone,5.0,"Now it's almost more than 2 weeks of usage and I'm fully satisfied with the performance. Earlier I was using oneplus 6T and after malfunction of the screen, i decided to move to Iphone. Before buying i had done all the R&D. Many of reviews says that it has bad battery life and couldn't stand a day. But as per my usages my battery stays all day long. I used to make call (6 to 7 hours), video, music, surfing everything except game and battery last upto 24 hours with data mode on.In my opinion its worth buying."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Faulty,1.0,The product found faulty after one week The microphone of speaker was not working in the phone. It Was in warranty period so got replaced by new one.
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Battery backup is non existent,1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Battery backup is worst. My 2 year old redmi note7 pro (12k) easily runs one  full day with more than 4 hour screen on time. But this new 60k phone almost dies with 2 hour Amazon music. Clearly not worth it. Apart from the 12mp ultra wide camera nothing else is impressive in this comparing to my old phone.  Updated to the latest iOS version. Running in low power mode. Still battery is draining. Since the replacement period is over, totally devastated. To conclude never buy an iPhone ever again. In video Battery charged to 96%. But after restarting the phone it shows 100%."

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,iPhone is like a Shadi ka Ladoo,1.0,"I was an Android user and had high hopes with this Apple gadget, however after 8 months of using this so hyped Apple device, I can finally say that an iPhone is similar to a Shadi ka ladoo ‚Äî jo Khaaye wo pachtaaye aur jo na khaye wo bhi pachtaaye. The reason I am saying this is because this phone lacks even the most basic features that even a 5k android phone has, like - call recording - which I eventually realised that it should have been an Apple feature instead of third party apps - which demand money and are pretty inconvenient to use.The second drawback is that call logs are auto erased and kept up to a certain stack size (100 / 102) and if you want to go back to pull any earlier call logs beyond this specified stack size, you won‚Äôt be able to do so and will have to rely on your network provider (if you are eligible) for the same.These are two very ground level use cases that fail to deliver in an Apple device and since I faced real life situations surrounding these two scenarios I feel that I it is not worth having this Phone and better to keep your ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù pants on.Then I thought why I bought this phone in the first place and got my answer - 1. Camera ??Android phones are easily  competing nicely with iPhone Camera now-a-days and some have even better camera.2. Brand marketing / re-selling value / durability ?? I am so over it now after 8 months of usage and the price keeps on sinking down as newer model enters the market so not a wise call I must sayFinal outcome:Definitely not a returning customer."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,"Excellent phone, beautiful colour‚ô•Ô∏è",4.0,"Excellent phone, only reason I have reduced one star is since Amazon reduced the price by Rs 3000 the day after I received the phone and this really hurts after spending so much of my hard earned money. Exchange value received for my older phone was also pretty inadequate, considering the condition it was in.Pros:1. The green colour is gorgeous2. Cameras are outstanding3. Battery life is really good, lasts me almost 2 days on a charge4. Screen is very bright and has vibrant colours5. Speaker is very loudCons:1. Just nitpicking, but a fingerprint sensor would have been much more convenient during Covid2. Indian variant doesn't have the mmWave antenna, inspite of being more expensive than the US VariantOverall, a great buy.TIP: Please do not buy 64 GB model, unless you have a robust cloud subscription to upload stuff into."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Product was switched off permanently,1.0,Product was switched off permanently after a week.
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Android user to iPhone user review,4.0,"I was an android user before using iPhone. So that this is my first experience handling with iOS.As an android user I felt little bit difficult while using iOS but later you would love it.Performance of this phone is awesome and outstanding. Photo and video quality, sound quality, connectivity etc all is good.I experienced the heating issue while charging and phone calls. But the coolant system is good, it will cool down quickly.Overall it‚Äôs a good phone."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,What a phone should be,5.0,"Upgraded from one plus 7 proNever used IOS before,Must say this is what phones are supposed to be.Just go for it.Early delivery by Amazon , Well packed and secure package."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,"After spending 60k on Amazon Rcvd Defected piece , sealed  was opened",1.0,"After spending 60k on Amazon Rcvd Defected piece , sealed  was opened & there was lots of scratches on IPhone, not expected this from amazon."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,I prefer the 11 or the 12 mini,3.0,"I have been an apple user for the past 10 years and this is the first phone which is disappointing. I was using the Xr and 11 before this and though of upgrading.1. If you are moving from an android to iPhone for the 1st time, its a great phone to get in terms of camera, processor, screen quality. But if you are already an existing iPhone user, upgrade only from XR downwards. That is if your are upgrading from a 8/X/XS/XR. If you have a 11, stick to it. Wait for the 13 or budget is not a constraint then get the 12 pro.2. form factor. Apple has gone back to rectangle brick design that they used in their earlier phones. Now for me this was one the reasons I didn't like the phone. It wasn't comfortable n the hand after being used to the curve of the X and 11 and XR3. Camera- best camera quality with night mode . u can't go wrong with this camera setup.4. screen- excellent screen quality , no complaints here.5. 5g - IS it really that big a deal breaker ? especially if you are in India where 5g seems a long way off.6. No charging adapter. You either have to connect it to your MacBook or buy a separate power adapter. When ur spending 70 odd grand, that's the least apple could offer.7. again no ear phones.8. It somehow doesn't have the wow factor as what the X had.Update.I exchange my phone for a 12 mini. much more easier to use with one hand and comfortable."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Poor manufacturing,1.0,Overall mobile is good but found blue spots on side and upper frame. This is not expected from Amazon. This is my worst order experience with Amazon. Really disappointing!
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Overpriced,4.0,Cons:1.Overpriced phone( which should be around 45k)2.No Adapter3.Ugly Layout at the side of screen.( Iphone xs max which i have has better layout)4.No Telephoto lense at this price seriously a joke
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,facing problem of less life in battery,2.0,"facing less life problem in battery, need to replace itvery poor service, pick up scheduled today 09.04.2021, however delivery boy not picked up the phone inspite of coming at our company, very poor service from amazon, we are very disappointed"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Moving from Android to iOS?,4.0,"Yes, it is a 5 star phone. But if you are moving from android to iPhone please be ready to lose your freedom. There is a lot available on internet to tell you about what you will lose out on. It is like speaking a new language altogether.Quick image editing, video editing, simple things like making collages, setting custom ringtones, quick editing of alarms, changing WiFi or Bluetooth, toggling location, many more basic features are either absent in iOS or managed in a very cumbersome way. You will miss them if moving from Andriod. Also be ready to lose your WhatsApp chat history. Not impressed by the sound reproduction on bigger speakers via Bluetooth and the very inflexible equilizer.For some silly reasons Apple is being stubborn on some aspects like standardisation of charging cable even within its own products. The notch at the top of the screen is still the same size it was in 2018.Rest, there are tons of reviews to praise the phone and I agree with most of them.Was a bit disappointed the way it was packaged. No foam or bubble wrap."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Everything is good but not te yellow tinted display !,4.0,"Completely satisfied with the performance , Camera and Battery life. But display totally disappointed me. There is an extra yellow tint for the display and colors are off. I am a photographer and colour grading artist. So accurate color reproduction is of almost importance to me. Please reconsider your decision if you are in similar profession"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Phone is good but apple is doing cheap thing that not providing adaptor,4.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Phone is awesome no doubt camera also as expected Smooth phoneBut There is no adaptor charger iphone provide only data cable people spend 85k and then again spend for 2k for charger that is very inappropriate this is not good people will not buy if this will continue providing not charger. What‚Äôs the meaning of phone people buy phone and don‚Äôt have charger to charge the phone first experience is mine for iphone is very bad because of charger. Because new c type adaptor is not getting everywhere how people will charge his phone. 85000 is a big amount so thing about it and provide full sets of charger."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Don't buy from Amazon,1.0,"Don't buy this phone from Amazon  . I got heating issue on this phone and when I reached the customer service they before the warranty , then they expected the letter of proof from Apple , even I shared that . The Amazon customer service people will give false promises .and and simply waste the time , and will never replace the time. I think someone who got their first iPhone on Amazon gives good rating. I had conversation with Apple customer care , they are getting multiple calls for iPhone bought from Amazon . Seems Amazon got all defective products from Apple and sold . When we go to Apple service centre , they are ready for service for this defective products."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,It's a refurbished phone,1.0,The phone already had a profile when I opened the settings. This is a refurbished phone. I logged in with my apple ID only to find another person has already been using this phone. This is clearly a refurbished item being sold as new. Please stop this cheating and refund my purchase.
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Doubtful product,4.0,What i am feeling is there is some difference buying products on amazon and stores directly. I have compared with my friends battery life has huge change she gets a day and mine ends within 7-8 hours
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,The only Eco-friendly Device,4.0,"Buy it if you really worried about environment and carbon emissions, apple is taking care of it by not providing adaptor, you will still buy it @ 2K but that adaptor work on biogas, very eco-friendly, it sucksOverall good buy, it help you keep High status in the society, really good device to use also, you should buy it on discount and in collaboration with your family and partner. There is a screen in the front with apple logo at the back, A top notch bazzle visible from miles, battery might not run for a day, but people do still admire the dead iphone which is great thing to be part of, other than this sound quality is better, camera awesome, full pack of connectivity issues, you will be able to know how capable you are to find the solutions."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Unworthy for the Price _ Ear Speaker Failure,3.0,"In just 5 months the ear speaker of iPhone 12 failed and stopped working.iPhone store is not very customer friendly, they make you wait and then ask numerous silly question.Time requested to investigate the problem is unreasonable. In today's world when we are addicted to phone and cannot part for minutes they ask for weeks to only investigate.WE GET BETTER SERVICE WHEN WE SPEND 1000 Rs at a restaurant than what we get at iPhone store after spending 85000 Rs."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Intelligence of future,5.0,"I was an avid android user for past 25 years. This move to IPhone 12 was a calculative yet bolder definitive move.Let‚Äôs look at the some of key pointers here what I saw -- Stunning design and spectacular OLed display pouring out all the vivid colors- Smooth app flow and transitions- Longer battery life 7-8 hrs without automation (best in my usage)-  Camera is just bringing the life out of all the captures you make.*I am using Apple 20w charger which is insane at charging 20-25 percent in 7 mins. So, In 15 mins, you are having half the battery up. Love the border outlay of this beauty. It‚Äôs almost a month of usage and I can boldly say, ‚ÄúThe best switch one can make‚Äù. I know the price tag is always hefty but then you are choosing a long term reliability. Kudos to Apple Inc and Amazon for amazing delivery in 2 days.*Please avoid playing Apple Arcade games as they would drain you battery like anything. In my best guess, It is not rightly optimised for it.*What I come to see is why Apple looked for environmental protection by removing charger and earphones. I guess it should come at a reasonable price then. It really put me off but then you know what the market player is serving."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,"Awesome phone, don't step back beoz of bad reviews. Make ur dream come true üòÄ",5.0,"The media could not be loaded.

I'm very excited with my new phone.. battery life is also good. Face is awesomepart and camera quality at picks... best deal for this independence day üòçü§©"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Best phone I could bought,5.0,"This is my first iPhone purchase , coming from oneplus 7 I don't have any regrets about the switch. Yes the switch was painful (especially because I lost all my whatsapp chats) but is worth it. comparing to oneplus 7, this phone has all features from it but in better form. My OP7 was smooth, fast had good battery camera,battery and  haptics. iPhone is just way smoother,fast and have great camera,battery and haptics. There is a slight learning curve. took 2 days to get used to gestures and navigations but is smooth sailing. the only negative feedback would be no charger in the box. You will have to get from apple.com if you want fast 20W one."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,It worked for me.,5.0,"Although I still believe, people are scammed. This was my first ever iPhone, and I took a risk to buy it from Amazon, as there was a huge discount in sale. I was very afraid, and video captured complete unboxing with all EMEI numbers etc. At the end, I got completely genuine and working new product. Thanks Amazon !!"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,"Packing was extremely cheap, could have damaged my product",4.0,"You are sending a phone of worth so much and using such cheap packing .. great. Atleast a box would have worked well too.I tried making video of my product to be sure that i received a phone and not a soap or brick but the delivery guy refused and said 'its not written on my face that I'm a fraud ' and 'its your product, you are responsible for what it is inside the package'.Thankfully I have not received a brick but what if I have ? Who would have been responsible?Who would have paid for my loss ?If you are ordering expensive items , make sure to capture the video and ask delivery guy to open before submitting OTP..With god's grace i have received my phone. Will update after using for a while."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,My first iPhone,5.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†This is my first iPhone and the phone is really awesome as i have seen in lots of reviews. I am already aware with iOS since i have iPad. I have pocof1 which i bought in 2018 and after spending 3 years with Android i made up my mind to move to iOS. The packaging was well and I recieved the phone in 1 day."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Not happy with performance,1.0,"phone having minor touch issue after 8 month of purchase, since issue is minor, due to covid & staying at remote location not able to contact apple. Now from yesterday it has major touch issue.I have already using Apple Macbook,ipad. These product are having very good performance but This Iphone's performance is very bad. I feel that purchasing Iphone at a cost of around 80k is not worthy."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Most secure and beautiful iPhone,5.0,"Those who already use iPhone, no need of explanation.Coming to specific model iPhone 12 ‚Ä¶Most of the features are same as IPhone 12 Pro, like -->1.  6.1 inch Super Retina XDR display  (OLED display), with 2532x1170-pixel resolution at 460 ppi2.  A14 bionic Chip & Next-generation Neural Engine3.  Dual 12MP camera system (Ultra Wide and Wide)4.  5G, Ceramic Shield front, Compatible with MagSafe, True tone, Haptic Touch ‚Ä¶.Those who are not bothered about LiDAR, Telephoto mode, Apple ProRAW, stainless steel frame and wants to save around 30K bucks should go with iPhone 12. If those things matter you most then go for iPhone 12 Pro with additional 30K bucks.By the way, aerospace-grade aluminum frame in iPhone 12 looks stunning. I am very much happy with iPhone 12."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,A14 Bionic. The beast in all segments,5.0,"I have been using iPhone 12 from past 20days. Overall a great phone with best battery life, best camera and great display. The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It‚Äôs top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price.For the price apple should have provided a charging brick and earphones, but they have not. Currently Amazon is selling this phone for 73k which is the best deal. Go for it."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Extremely bad call quality,1.0,I keep hearing crackling sound when on calls. There is no voice clarity and it takes like 10 mins to connect to call. My cheaper android phone is so smooth in call quality and connects instantly. Both the phones have same network carrier.Can I get this phone replaced or get refunded?
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,An Apple makes the day better !!!‚ù§Ô∏è,5.0,"I was initially very much afraid to buy apple phone because I never liked ios or apple ecosystem, but when I used this it was just awesome!You cannot compete the smoothness with any other device.My thoughts/ rating:-Camera : Good but selfie cam is not upto the markUI : user friendly and easy once you get to know itPerformance : UnbeatableAudio : Best‚Ä¶ its like surround sound system!Fit and finish : The best!If you agree with my views please hit the Like button below ! Thanks!"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Apple should wait for at least 2 years before launching a new iPhone.,4.0,"Well they are a multinational conglomerate and I have simply purchased a product of theirs, so I shouldn‚Äôt be commenting on their product launching strategy. However keeping this aside, I would try to genuinely help those looking for reviews before buying, in a few simple steps.1. Go for it if you are going for an upgrade after  3-4 years, as it will give you some flawless experience again.2. Battery life is not upto the mark, I feel XR that I used before this had a good battery, maybe I am wrong.3. Face ID has got no significant improvement at all, again I think XR had a better face detection.4. Camera I could sense something has been done.5. Coming to interface and product performance, it is flawless, smooth, faster."

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Nearly there to being just the perfect phone,5.0,"I have been an android user and shifting to Apple was a real uphill task in my thoughts. Proved quite the opposite.

Gets around 4.5-5 hrs screen time with 47% remaining (last checked). Initially while restoring from iCloud it would consume a lot of battery. Give it a day or two. It would settle down."

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Must Try | Over Priced,5.0,"This is the first IOS device for me after using an android until now. No doubt the transition was smooth. The camera is superb. It has FLAGSHIP LEVEL CAMERA. I need to charge it once for full day usage(not an heavy user) while using internet. OLED display is superb. Being an Android user since start, I was not able to restore my Whatsapp data in IOS which was one of the drawbacks. Overall it is good phone but overpriced. You won't get charger and earphones. There is a challenge to try new apps as most of the apps in IOS are paid  with just 3-7 days trial period. There are other brands in market who provides similar features at very less cost but at the end it's IOS vs Android."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,iPhone is iphone,5.0,iPhone is iPhone. Switched from Honor Flagship phone and it was smooth transition. Delivery by Amazon is just wow.

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,A Powerpacked Device that ticks all the boxes,5.0,"Having transitioned from the World of Android to IOS, it seems like a truckload of difference in these 2 worlds.... The Simplicity, Refinement and Ease of Use on this Ecosystem is just too Classic.... The Battery Life, The Haptics, The Camera and the overall Fluidity of IOS makes an impressive impact in terms usage....

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,The BOSS Phone..!!! iPhone 12 truly a masterpiece from Apple.,5.0,"I am writing this review after using my iPhone 12 for three weeks and I must say the decision I took to switch from android(I have been an android user for the last 8years xD xD) to iOS has been incredible. The experience is commendable, iPhone 12 is the best phone in the market as of now.  I haven‚Äôt faced any battery issue or any heating issues as I have seen other reviews complaining the battery and heating of the iPhone. Attached are a few sample shots I took from my iPhone to show that the Apple‚Äôs camera quality is unmatched and surreal.  The Face unlock is great, the battery‚Äôs pretty good, camera‚Äôs excellent‚Ä¶.overalls my whole transition from android to iOS has been great. Go for this phone guysss‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs the best in the segment with some mind blowing iOS features. P.S. Just got updated to iOS 14.6 üòäüòäüòä"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Excellent!,5.0,"Superb phone! Amazing same day delivery!I have more to add to my earlier review after roughly a month of use. The phone is an original Apple device. It's smooth and quick, and it doesn't become hot when in use or charging. The charge lasts the entire day (I use it mostly for social media, web browsing and music) Face recognition is excellent. Battery health is 100% (check this when you receive your phone under ‚Äòbattery health' in settings) and to keep it that way, make sure you close all background apps while the phone is not in use. Play a ‚Äòpixel test 4K' video on YouTube to see if your phone monitor has any dead pixels. I use the original Apple adaptor (which must be purchased separately) and the type C cable that comes in the box. Overall the phone is a great purchase!"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Value for money at that price,5.0,Excellent product and value for money at that price way better than one plus pro 5g at that price because iphone 12 supprts all the band's of 5G and camera screen are as usual excellent privacy always built-in for apple products üëç
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,No Comparison!!,5.0,"Its outstanding. I was using iphone 12 mini. Size wise this is better. This is amazing machine. Camera is great, performance is amazing, display is outstanding. Using iPhone 12 is some thing I never experience before. This is fantastic device.RatingsSpeed - 5/5Display - 5/5Battery - 5/5Weight - 5/5Camera - 5/5I cant give any less rating. This is just great. One thing I like to say if you like big screens then better to go with Pro max. Rest this is killer."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Kind of disappointed on battery health and during camera usage,3.0,"Well this is iphone but for me it‚Äôs another phone. Battery backup is one issue when you continually use it for couple of hours like imovie, camera or editing apps. Battery health got depleted to 91% and not sure I don‚Äôt game or edit things every day. This should be a beast on multitasking but yeah it is what it is. I‚Äôm gonna sell this one sometime. Even there are recommendations to use genuine products but it‚Äôs kind of overrated. Apple should seriously work on this battery part."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,iPhone 12- The Best!,5.0,"What to say about iPhone 12? Amazing Phone, loaded with all the features, Screen quality, camera quality, sound quality- all are superb. Moreover, 20W charger from Apple provides fast charging. 10/10. Enjoying my buddy, iPhone 12, you rock!"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Android to iPhone switch,4.0,"Hopefully this will be my first and last iphone as I am not accustomed with IOS environment.

Since apple user since many years, it was time to upgrade from iphone 7 to iphone 12, 256 GB config. Didn't find much difference in 13 and 12, so the price I got for 12 was decent balance for the upgrade. Feature wise I miss fingerprint scanner compared to previous version. Not a big fan of facescanner !üòü"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Apple iphone 12 is the best flagship phone .,5.0,Bought this phone after along comparison with S21 plus.why i bought Iphone 12 -1. 6'1 inch screen is good compare to foot long 6.7 flagship now days.2. display quality is superb.3. got on a discounted rate.4. working on Apple eco system as i already have i pad mini for gaming and multi media purpose.5. look classy.6. light weight.7.

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,What to say about iphone,5.0,Was using iphone x still have it one of the best iphone made by apple.Just know if you having other apple products like your laptop is an macbook you having ipad too and you have iwatch and other apple products then having an iphone is totally worth it but if you want an iphone just for the sake of having an iphone then you are on mistake.
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Great phone. Prices in India not so great,4.0,Battery life is good. Great display. Point and shoot is always good on iphones. Phone has all that you need.Prices is always high and we still buy like fools and to top it we dont get earphones nor the power brick.The last thing is we do not get quality military standard drop protective cases which is the worst thing its nothing related to phone but good to know info. Even if you get they are some of the worst ones and price is atleast three time more compared to the original product price.And if your buying Apple warranty you will keep draining your money as they have the worst support. They only believe in replacements and I am sure its not worth it to pay 18k for an year.
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Good phone .. üëç,5.0,"Apple 12 is a decent phone to upgrade if you are using any apple phone below X.. If you are using 11 or 11 pro, I would say just wait till the next version or the next ..

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Never buying again or reccomending others.,1.0,Reviewing after 10 days of use. I am very dissapointed with the battery life. Back camera is ok but the heating issue is worst. May be I have expected alot. And also no return policy by amazon on this product.
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Perfect if this is what you want,5.0,"What I Liked.1) Weight Balancing2) Battery Optimisation3) Software update upon unboxing4) Camera and Security featuresWhat I didn't like1) Limitations of common Charger. I have to use different charging cables for my iPhone, while my iPad Pro, Samsung Buds etc share a USB C cable.2) Some advertised features require the support of additional devices of Apple Eco System. For example, Apple said with iOS 15.3 face ID will work even with Masks On. But I just learned that this feature works only if you have an iWatch also.3) Not a gamer, but still for this price point at least a 90Hz refresh was desirable.4) Front Camera, sometimes have not of noise (nitpicking)At the end of the day, I am happy with my purchase. But I strongly recommend this phones to enthusiasts and upgraders only."

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Bad customer support and no support on replacement of defective product received .,1.0,"I ordered iphone 12 blue,128gb started showing issues. It was getting restarted on its own after every 15 mins or so. The display started lagging and and at times the device was completely unresponsive leading to unexpected shutdowns all this happened in merely 5 days of using it. And upon contacting customer support I was informed by Ms. Tuleshwari from support team to connect with Brand and in case the brand is ready to issue a service report they will initiate the replacement request. Upon getting the service report done from Apple service centre the support team staff Mr. Sanjay on outright basis denied replacment stating we cant issue basis the report. It's the brand who will have to be contacted. Customer service and support is clearly lacking with a brand like Amazon. What's the point of claiming of a free 7 day replacement policy when the support team clearly twists it as per their own convenience. I have had a experience of lifetime and would highly recommend no one to buy from Amazon. They are best at not helping consumers whatsover.  #patheticpolicies #poorcustomerservice"

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,More Reasonable Now.,5.0,"If you know where to look, you can find this phone for fifty two for the sixty four version. My review is based on that pricing as I got my father one of those just yesterday and here is what i have noticed.PROS -a) Great build quality, very light phone. After using an 11pro max and a 13pro max this size is so much easier to behold and a lot easier without bells and whistles.b) Good Camera set up - you will get two options, normal and zoom out. Both are clear and perfectly adequate.c) Nice loud speakersd) Oled Display - not the best display but this was apple's foray into a non-pro phone with OLED display and it was a very successful onee) Software - Apple software is great and the processor is speedy.f) Great voice quality and good signal - again somehting to behold and cherish.g) Face ID is supe fasth) Speedy now and speedy after 3 years also.CONS -Some may think this is expensive (but please note after 2 years you will still be able to get half of the value in return. That is something only Apple does well so cost of ownership works out to around 1000 a month)Feels very flimsy and insubstantial without case owing to less weightNo finger print scanner. Apple support is terrible.OPTIONS - If you want to go for an android i recommend the fan edition version of Samsungs, a one plus 9pro or a pixel 4a. The pixel 4a is best value. The one plus is good for photos but video is not even as good as an iPhone 8. Apple has best video in class across the last 3 years."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Price could have been to 75k,4.0,"Great phone no doubt, but for the price given the battery capacity should‚Äôve been 3000mah and above.Pros1. Touch feel is improved and smooth2. Getting a bigger ram is a plus point3. Esim is working fine4. Voice clarity is improved (compared with my iPhone 7)Cons1. Battery life...Note- Upgraded from iPhone 7 Recommend for the people who are using  iPhone 8 and below models."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Really ü§• not a good product,1.0,I request you please don't buy Apple mobile online because the display quality and camera quality is very bad.If you don't believe then you go your nearest Reliance Digital Store/Croma/Apple Store and compare your camera quality & display quality.Please don't buy
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Service Woes....Defective product combined with Poor Service...read on......,1.0,"Given a 1 Star as Apple continues to sell a defective product without resolving reported issues worldwideBeware: Buy at your own LUCK. This is solely based on my 2 months of experience with a defective iPhone12 128GB purchased from Amazon.Part I - The Rise of 'iPhone'The Saga began with an aspiration to buy a quality iPhone, feedback was that it never hangs....but wait no one told me that it won't hang till it works . This came as a gift to me from my wife, seeing my aspiration, she also got inspired and jumped the Gun to buy it on my birthday......But none of us imagined the nightmare it will become if you got yourself a defective piece. Don't believe me, search for ""iPhone 12 non-responsive screen"". You will get heartburns reading how many of them have non-responsive screens and have not worked even after replacement of whole phone itself, one guy had it replaced 3 times but issue kept coming back.It seems iPhone 12 is a defective buildAfter approx 15-20 days I started seeing same issue of phone unlocking(face unlock) but then nothing used to work on the touch screen. You are effectively not able to walk past the unlocked screen.If you locked and unlocked again, touch screen would start functioning till the next time it would behave in the same manner. I installed the apple support app to diagnose the issue and luckily the touchscreen issues went away without any trace.But wait, I wasnt so lucky, the same issue crept back exactly on the 54th day but this time with a vengeance, the phone simply wouldn't unlock no matter what you do. You can see the screen, it would charge and reboot and all that . Now began the nightmare which is the Part II.Part II - The Phantom(iPhone service) menace- No direct way to contact India customer support, only through chat and they will do an automated call back- First they tell me the usual workarounds, press button A, B, C etc etc. which I have already tried, standard procedures eating up so much time- Next after frustrating 30 min call with them, they send me instructions over email to take backup and do a factory restore(ignoring the fact that the touch screen isnt working)- As expected cannot take backup using itunes due to the PIN which requires your touch screen to work, frustrations are on the peak.- Now I reach back to support and they are trying to get me an appointment with the nearest service center, their service locator app is not working and I am scheduled a call back.- I wait at the designated schedule but I get a mail that I am not reachable, wait....my number is pre-fixed with a +91 and the automated call back is also adding another +91......shikes I will never get a call back.- Now I try to reach out to them, with the frustrations at the peak, didn't want to talk to them so started a chat session and luckily got the appointment with them in the next hour.- Reached the Service center, they asked me to wait, diagnosed and found that the iphone screen is not responsive, have to seek guidance from Apple.- After a week of checking online status which didnt change, I called the service center and asked for status. I am told that they are waiting for parts from Apple. I told them I am not interested, either replace the whole handset or refund the money.-I am provided Apple support number to talk to, as it a decision that has to come from Apple.- I immediately call Apple support and have a long conversation of over 45 minutes in which they are defiant to replace the handset and insist that they provide quality repair in India which after repairs will be like new only.- I offer them this ""NEW"" repaired phone and to give me my money back. I also state that in the USA, they replace and in INDIA is a repair, to which I am given an answer that every region has a different policy.....how discriminatory.- The call ends after 45 minutes of strong discussions that I will evaluate the quality of repair and then only accept the phone back. But with still no change in status on their site, I am not sure if they even know what to do with these screen issues on iPhonePart III - The Empire Strikes Back- For many days apple service did not have a clue on whats happening except for waiting for Apple to respond- After multiple followups and posts on twitter, got some attention- Repaired phone(not acceptable) was returned after 13 days with chassis replaced- Poor service for one of ""the"" expensive phones on this planet, Apple has taken Indian customers for granted. I am sure they would have replaced the phone immediately in US.BAD overall experience, has spoiled the product ownership experience forever."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,"Good phone overall, but lack some features and a bit overpriced",4.0,"Pros:1) Display and camera quality is good for the price2) Super fast and lag free experience3) looks and build quality is top notch (I like the boxy shape)4) iOS integration and Apple ecosystem works like a charm if u have other apple devices5) battery life is good6) Resale value due to ‚ÄúApple brand‚Äù: is goodCons:1) No zoom lens at this price (camera isn‚Äôt versatile due to that)2) face Id and notch: due to mask, doesn‚Äôt work (fingerprint sensor is a must have these days)3) overpriced in India by at-least ‚Çπ15000-200004) very slow charging speed5) no adapter in the box6) iOS limitations if you are coming from android (no dual whatsapp, no call recording, split screen multitasking, home screen customisations, etc)7) 60hz Display and that big notch again, is a let down"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Phones have gone crazy with Price.,1.0,"Apple and Samsung both are in a price war off late, also buying a phone worth 80k in India leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I'm not judging anyone who buys this, but we are still a developing nation, with children dying of hunger, spend money wisely, Don't give in to the Instagram fueled dystopia."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,"Not worth for the price, go for Samsung S20",3.0,"!!!Worst phone ever seen in my life.. only apple fanboys can buy this, have already a Samsung flagship phone thats very smooth than this..1 camera poor quality shots for this price.. Samsung good natural compare to this.2 zooming quality Very pathetic3 RAM Very low for the price so latest game loading takes more time than Samsung4 under performing HW specs5 very less app. Collection compare to android6 can't installed app from internal memory at least purchased app. So every time when app get updated .. u need to pay money and buy them again..so stupid..7 local shop can not repair/replace display, battery, camera..apple made like that..so need to take to apple service.. they charge u hell...at end u have to send ur property for service8 still so many issues..it is like buying costly luxury car/girl ..more maintanence less milege9 will workout for the country like US where they can rent mobile and return back when problem..not for india..So don't throw ur money in dust bin for the sake of prestige issue.."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Okay,5.0,"Why some people are cracking lame jokes iphone with kidneys. If you are that poor that you cannot afford an iPhone until you sell a kidney, go within the budget. Stop this crap."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Great Purchase,5.0,"At the right time, fair price would be about 48k after cash back, disc, etc for the 128GB variant.For 1st time users, if you are confused between the iPhone and iPhone Mini, I would recommend that you visit a retail store to get the look and feel of the phone before making a purchase decision online. I found the Mini to be too small. My finger always landed on top of the camera at the back.Also, it helps to get a better perspective on the colour options. The blue one is a very deep blue. The white variant is Off white with Silver edges on the sides."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Phone with defect.,2.0,Never buy an iPhone from amazon etc.  I bought an iPhone 7 back in 2017 and after a year it randomly stopped working and was stuck on the apple logo! Amazon does not help at all.Instead pay a little extra and buy it from apple or unicorn since they‚Äôre authorised sellers.
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Getting heated up,1.0,"Never ever buy iphone on sale from amazon. I had heating issues on the first day of usage. In the sense using camera fr 1 min caused my device to heat up.Contacted apple still i had unfavourable reception . Amazon offers 10 days replacement, but they never cease to reply if any query is being put forward. Never ever buy an iphone from online merchants.Could hav put 0 stars if there was an option."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Satisfied with switching to first iPhone,4.0,"So far I had used android phones only and this was first time switching to iOS. The phone runs very smoothly and flawlessly. It have beautiful design and colour, thoughtfully designed UI and it feels perfect to hold in hand (not too small not too large). Face ID is excellent and quick, don‚Äôt heat at all, except a little bit while charging. Colours are realistic and sharp. Battery goes for a day with normal usage but could have been better."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Buy apple if you need a overpriced camera,1.0,"Not worth the money, I think apple deliberately selling inferior products to India. All 5 star ratings are from apple fanboys who are interested in Instagram pictures (since camera is only good ). I request people to buy only Samsung as they are truly ""smartphone"". plus their strong make in india commitment. Never heard of any violence in samsung factories."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Beauty + Beast,5.0,"I have been an Android power user for 12+ years having used over 6 high end devices. I have enjoyed using every android device and was super comfortable having full control over Android OS/ecosystem (highly customizable options).iPhone 12 or rather iOS is in entirety a different world altogether. Simple, elegant, amazingly powerful, rich features and fully secure. iPhone 12 is a stunning beauty with a beastly performance. Simply put - iPhone 12 is vivacious, curvaceous, elegant, attractive and just feels so good. It's design is impeccable and purple of all looks super stunning.Now for the specs:1) A14 Bionic Chip: First chip in the smartphone industry built on a 5-nanometer process for performance and efficiency improvements. The 6-core CPU and 4-core GPU in the A14 is 50 percent faster than the fastest competing smartphone chips. Also includes a 16-core Neural Engine that offers an 80 percent increase in performance for machine learning tasks2) Camera: 27 percent more light for better performance in low-light conditions along with 2x optical zoom and 5x digital zoom. The photos are just brilliant, even in low light conditions. This iPhone can capture 30fps HDR video with Dolby Vision, enabling cinema-grade videos. For video fanatics this iPhone offers 4K HDR video recording3) Display: 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display / 2532x1170 resolution. It's a treat to watch videos on this iPhone. It's lively & pixel perfect.4) Battery: Well, this one is a slight bummer. Yes, much depends on your daily usage but overall it's pretty good.5) Security/Privacy: iOS is a closed ecosystem which gives less control to developers. This is the single biggest edge iOS has. Their review systems for developer is a cut above the rest. Though iPhones are vulnerable to hackers/viruses the chances are minimal because of their exhaustive sec measures6) Design: I love the new design of the iPhone 12. In addition to being smaller and lighter, it has flat sides and a flat screen.The iPhone 13 still doesn't cut above iPhone 12 in many aspects. I believe iPhone 12 is still the best smartphone until the launch of iPhone 14 (with some real tangible features & not just settling for some minor tweaks). Though it's been a full 1 year since it's launch, iPhone 12 is very much worth buying."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Decent phone with no so perfect battery,4.0,"Lol there is no fingerprint reader on this phone and Amazon is asking for its rating.Okay back to the reviewPhone is great, doesn‚Äôt lag, have very good screen display. But the battery life is poor. Lasts for a day but it‚Äôs okay as we all are used to charge our phones whenever/wherever we see a power socket.Camera quality is awesome and better than that the image editing tools. Apple is known for it‚Äôs image editing and video editing and this phone just justifies it.Also a decent size phone neither too big nor too small.If you want to stand away from the crowd and are bored of using the Android you can very well go for it blindly."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Just Awesome..after all it‚Äôs Apple Ô£ø,4.0,"Hi all,I bought this 128GB white iPhone12 from offline market around 70k and gifted it to my wife. Been 2months, she is quite happy with her daily usage experience. It‚Äôs light weight and battery after one charge lasts for a day or more with constant Wi-Fi ON. Happy with the purchase."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,IPhone 12 review-sindhuja Badigineni,5.0,"The iPhone 12 is the fanciest smart phone in the market currently. The iPhone is assembled with great care and caution so as to successfully meet the evolving customer needs. In order to demonstrate Apple‚Äôs commitment to meeting the needs of its consumers, this paper provides a product review of the IPhone 12.This phone costs ‚Çπ72,999 but it is worth the price.  First of all, the IPhone 12 has a beautiful design. Many customers are concerned about how their phone looks. Unlike other phones that do not address this need, IPhone has an aesthetic feel. The IPhone 12 is also lighter compared to many other phone models (McFedries 12). This means that the phone is easy to carry both in the pocket and by hand. The weight of the phone matters because in many cases, heavier phones face the risk of dropping to the floor in case one is multitasking while handling the phone. In addition, it is sometimes uncomfortable to carry a heavy phone in the pocket because it often wears off due to the heavy weight. In addition to the light weight that characterizes the iPhone 12, it is important to understand that the phone has a higher speed in terms of internet connection and detection compared to other phones and the IPhone 11 model. This means that consumers will be able to enjoy the fast internet as they surf the internet. Considering the growing need for accessing the internet in daily activities such as social media, iPhone 12 is an ideal phone to possess.  In addition to faster internet and Wi-Fi the iPhone 12 has a great GPS and location service (Cohen 31).This means that there is no need for purchasing a GPS if one possesses an iPhone 12. This shows that the iPhone12 is cost effective because one can save money for gadgets such as a GPS because the iPhone12 provides the same service. In addition to the GPS, the iPhone 12 can store large quantities of data, especially music. With an iPhone 12 one does not have to purchase an iPod for the purposes of listening to music. One can either save music directly on the iPhone12 or use a memory card to save music. In addition to music, the iPhone 12 has an excellent camera. The neatness of the pictures taken using the iPhone 12 is greater than other phones such as Android models and the iPhone 11. It is also important to note that the iPhone 12 provides a wide range of photo editing software compared to other phones in the market. Therefore, in addition to saving money that would be used to buy a GPS, one can also save money that could be used to buy a camera. The iPhone 12 also comes with excellent ringtones that can be assigned to each caller in the phone contacts. This is a characteristic that is not available in many phone models and those phones that have the service do not have nice ringtones.  In addition to the software component of the iPhone 12, it is important to note that this phone's battery is long-lasting (Kelby & White 29). This means that the iPhone 12 can be able to stay charged for a longer time compared to many other phone models. For example, Android phones are known to drain their charge in a short period. Therefore, if one is looking for a phone that has a long battery life, the iPhone 12 is the ideal phone to purchase"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,iPhone 12,5.0,Been using this for more than 3 months now must say one of the best experiencesI had moved from android to iOSI was not able to recover the what‚Äôs app back up and the phone doesn‚Äôt have a finger print unlock which feels as a must have feature speacially with the mask on face recognition is of no useApart from that the camera and screen display is spot on if you have the budget go for it
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Buy 12 instead of thirteen,4.0,Do not buy thirteen i use thirteen as secondary phone and it‚Äôs basically the same when it comes to iphone this is one of the best but do not buy 64 gigs thats the only huge problem buy 128Do not look The specs specs dont matter the battery is also so good it lasts abt  6 hours and it feels like heaven if u are a android user and wanna try ios go for it its way better i had s10 before this and now this is way better the camera is impeccable so clear just go for it I promise u wont regretThe minus points.No finger print ( face recognition accurate and from new update in can recognise even with mask on).notch (really not noticeable).little small (i like big phones )Plus points.good face recognition.

Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Cost cutting,4.0,"No Charging adapter, No earphones and charging cable is not enough lenghty.Hmm looks like the day is not far when Apple will sell the iphones without a box. lol"

Go for it without thinking too muchOnly data cable will be in the box along with phone no adapter or headphoneUse 20w adapter for fast and better chargingIts a 5G phone so as soon as 5G will launch you will be able to use"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Perfect,5.0,Had researched and wanted to buy through offline channel initially. But the deal here was really good. And delivery very prompt. Arrived in perfect packing. The product is working well with no isssues. Bought the adaptor seperately. No heating issues at all.  This is the single highest ticket size product purchase from Amazon till date and I am delighted. Bought it through Darshita Electronics seller here. Will recommend.
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,It‚Äôs just an update nothing special,4.0,Upgraded from iPhone x after over 3 years. I don‚Äôt see any major changes or upgrades instead I have a new charger which was to be bought. All in all it‚Äôs as good as the iPhone X was when new. Just one thing which is better is the speaker on the device and perhaps the camera is a little better.
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Better than androids almost in every category.,4.0,"This is my 1st iPhone after using androids for 10 years. I have started my android journey with Samsung galaxy S1 and after that HTC, ASUS, LG, many MI (including Mi3, first Xiaomi product in India) and since last 3 years 3 galaxy Latest series. To me camera is the most important feature for a mobile after making and taking calls. I was keen to buy S21 but felt apart from ultra other two are nothing special even not so premium like earlier galaxy series. By this time I broke my S20 plus and thinking for one plus 9pro but was not very happy with camera output, even lots of people are complaining about 888 chipset, and then I had only one choice it‚Äôs iPhone, I was very much in dilemma as it‚Äôs totally different OS with many restrictions. But somehow because of the camera I thought to give it a try, and man after 1 month I feel this is the best phone in the market. Other manufacturers must learn what‚Äôs called optimisation, that tinny battery can last for almost complete one working day, google apps work better than android, games work flawlessly . And safety and privacy is in different league, I can choose whether I‚Äôll allow the app to track my use or not, Xiaomi are you listening??? And camera is surely best if you want to exact colour and white balance. Only disappointments are , WhatsApp chat can‚Äôt be transfer from android, Truecaller doesn‚Äôt work properly, and the Ugly big notch, common apple we know you brought this screen to body ratio concept but this notch needs to be removed."
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Expensive beast..,5.0,"It's an expensive piece of beauty. Yes, despite the price cut during the sale, I got this 128gb iPhone 12 for around seventy three kBut that's just the phone we are talking about, the charger and Type A to lightning port was another 2k ishAnd since this is an iPhone, the back cover and tempered glass for another 1k. So the total costed around seventy six k which is double of my previous phone (OnePlus 5t)It's still one heck of a Phone. Putting down few reasons on why to go for it:1) True Flagship - if you are planning to buy a phone above fifty k, android won't give you that experience, as even a thirty k android gives more or less similar performance to a flagship android2) Cameras - It has the best camera, totally worth it3) Privacy - if you don't want personalised ads to pop based on what you speak, browse or show interest for, then go for it.4) Build quality - The phone looks very strong and compact. I hate 6.7 inches phones5) If you don't have an iPhone, you don't have an iPhone"
Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Blue,Try to understand what is best in Iphone,3.0,"Too much heating problem when I listen songs in the mobile and camera also not that much great. Recently I have migrated from android to iPhone observing lot of restrictions and accessories also costly have to spend good amount of money to buy all accessories, but I‚Äôm wondering why iPhone has that much craze what best in iPhone because Im not seeing much difference between one plus vs iPhone as both are providing same quality. I‚Äôm just trying to understand from last 3 months what is the special in iPhone compare to others except cost and to show society that I‚Äôm using iPhone. Folks please help me by providing your review if anyone have any pros of iPhone , it would be a  great help for me. I shall also try to do more analysis and post here if I see any best"

Sound quality(love it)4. Fast processor(come on!)5. And the biggest improvement was battery life( note that i was using iphone 6)It is a big imporvement in terms of battery life, if you are coming from iphone 6, 6s or 7 or even iphone 86. Camera is obviously great on iphoneCons.1. Battery should be of bigger size( as people tend to use iphone for around 2-3 years, i am exception, i used my iphone 6 for around 5-6 years with 3 times battery replacement!üòõ2. Should have included the charger as commonly people dont have apple type c charger in their house)3. Other than these two things everything is perfect.Noted:The notch doesnt significantly have any sort of trouble while using it!(actually you wont even noticed it.)*I would suggest to go for iphone 12 rather than 12 pro series, only the difference is of steel body and one extra camera!same spec. same processor, same battery... everything is same!Why would you pay extra 40k for just the steel body and extra camera!(the picture quality is same)Choice is yours!‚úåüèª"
